# Kapacitor API Reference Documentation

Kapacitor provides an HTTP API on port 9092 by default.
With the API you can control which tasks are executing, query status of tasks and manage recordings etc.

Each section below defines the available API endpoints and there inputs and outputs.

All requests are versioned and namespaced using the root path `/kapacitor/v1/`.

### Response Codes

All requests can return these response codes:

| HTTP Response Code | Meaning                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | -------                                                                                                                                                             |
| 2xx                | The request was a success the content is dependent on the request.                                                                                                  |
| 4xx                | Invalid request, refer to error for what it wrong with the request. Repeating the request will continue to return the same error.                                   |
| 5xx                | The server was unable to process the request, refer to the error for a reason. Repeating the request may result in a success if the server issue has been resolved. |

### Errors

All requests can return JSON in the following format to provide more information about a failed request.

```
{
    "error" : "error message"
}
```

### Query Parameters vs JSON body

To make using this API a consistent and easy experience we follow one simple rule for when extra information
about a request is found in the query parameters of the URL or when they are part of the submitted JSON body.

Query parameters are used only for GET requests and all other requests expect parameters to be specified in the JSON body.

>NOTE: The /kapacitor/v1/write endpoint is the one exception to this rule since Kapacitor is compatible with the InfluxDB /write endpoint.

## Writing Data

Kapacitor can accept writes over HTTP using the line protocol.
This endpoint is identical in nature to the InfluxDB write endpoint.

| Query Parameter | Purpose                               |
| --------------- | -------                               |
| db              | Database name for the writes.         |
| rp              | Retention policy name for the writes. |

>NOTE: Kapacitor scopes all points by their database and retention policy. This means you MUST specify the `rp` for writes or Kapacitor will not know which retention policy to use.

#### Example

Write data to Kapacitor.

```
POST /kapacitor/v1/write?db=DB_NAME&rp=RP_NAME
cpu,host=example.com value=87.6
```

For compatibility with the equivalent InfluxDB write endpoint the `/write` endpoint is maintained as an alias to the `/kapacitor/v1/write` endpoint.

```
POST /write?db=DB_NAME&rp=RP_NAME
cpu,host=example.com value=87.6
```

## Tasks

A task represents work for Kapacitor to perform.
A task is defined by its id, type, TICKscript, and list of database retention policy pairs it is allowed to access.

### Define Task

To define a task POST to the `/kapacitor/v1/tasks/` endpoint.
If a task already exists then use the `PATCH` method to modify any property of the task.

Define a task using a JSON object with the following options:

| Property | Purpose                                                                |
| -------- | -------                                                                |
| id       | Unique identifier for the task. If empty a random ID will be chosen.   |
| type     | The task type: `stream` or `batch`.                                    |
| dbrps    | List of database retention policy pairs the task is allowed to access. |
| script   | The content of the script.                                             |
| status   | One of `enabled` or `disabled`.                                        |

When using PATCH, if any option is missing it will be left unmodified.

#### Example

Create a new task with ID TASK_ID.

```
POST /kapacitor/v1/tasks/
{
    "id" : "TASK_ID",
    "type" : "stream",
    "dbrps": [{"db": "DATABASE_NAME", "rp" : "RP_NAME"}],
    "script": "stream\n    |from()\n        .measurement('cpu')\n"
}
```

Response with task id and link.

```
{
    "id" : "TASK_ID",
    "link" : {"rel": "self", "href": "/kapacitor/v1/tasks/TASK_ID"}
}
```

Modify only the dbrps of the task.

```
PATCH /kapacitor/v1/tasks/TASK_ID
{
    "dbrps": [{"db": "NEW_DATABASE_NAME", "rp" : "NEW_RP_NAME"}]
}
```

>NOTE: Setting any DBRP will overwrite all stored DBRPs.


Enable an existing task.

```
PATCH /kapacitor/v1/tasks/TASK_ID
{
    "status" : "enabled",
}
```

Disable an existing task.

```
PATCH /kapacitor/v1/tasks/TASK_ID
{
    "status" : "disabled",
}
```

Define a new task that is enabled on creation.

```
POST /kapacitor/v1/tasks/TASK_ID
{
    "type" : "stream",
    "dbrps" : [{"db": "DATABASE_NAME", "rp" : "RP_NAME"}],
    "script" : "stream\n    |from()\n        .measurement('cpu')\n",
    "status" : "enabled"
}
```

Response with task id and link.

```
{
    "id" : "TASK_ID",
    "link" : {"rel": "self", "href": "/kapacitor/v1/tasks/TASK_ID"}
}
```

#### Response

| Code | Meaning                                     |
| ---- | -------                                     |
| 200  | Success, contains id and link for new task. |
| 404  | Task does not exist                         |

## Recordings

Kapacitor can save recordings of data and replay them against a specified task.

### Start Recording

There are three methods for recording data with Kapacitor:
To create a recording make a POST request to the `/kapacitor/v1/recordings/METHOD` endpoint.

| Method | Description                                        |
| ------ | -----------                                        |
| stream | Record the incoming stream of data.                |
| batch  | Record the results of the queries in a batch task. |
| query  | Record the result of an explicit query.            |

The request returns once the recording is started and does not wait for it to finish.
A recording ID is returned to later identify the recording.

##### Stream

| Parameter | Purpose                                                                    |
| --------- | -------                                                                    |
| id        | Unique identifier for the recording. If empty a random one will be chosen. |
| task      | ID of a task, used to only record data for the DBRPs of the task.          |
| stop      | Record stream data until stop date.                                        |

##### Batch

| Parameter | Purpose                                                                                                          |
| --------- | -------                                                                                                          |
| id        | Unique identifier for the recording. If empty a random one will be chosen.                                       |
| task      | ID of a task, records the results of the queries defined in the task.                                            |
| start     | Earliest date for which data will be recorded. RFC3339Nano formatted.                                            |
| stop      | Latest date for which data will be recorded. If not specified uses the current time. RFC3339Nano formatted data. |
| cluster   | Name of a configured InfluxDB cluster. If empty uses the default cluster.                                        |

##### Query

| Parameter | Purpose                                                                    |
| --------- | -------                                                                    |
| id        | Unique identifier for the recording. If empty a random one will be chosen. |
| type      | Type of recording, `stream` or `batch`.                                    |
| query     | Query to execute.                                                          |
| cluster   | Name of a configured InfluxDB cluster. If empty uses the default cluster.  |

>NOTE: A recording itself is typed as either a stream or batch recording and can only be replayed to a task of a corresponding type.
Therefore when you record the result of a raw query you must specify the type recording you wish to create.


#### Example

Create a recording using the `stream` method

```
POST /kapacitor/v1/recordings/stream
{
    "task" : "TASK_ID",
    "stop" : "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00"
}
```

Create a recording using the `batch` method specifying a start time.

```
POST /kapacitor/v1/recordings/batch
{
    "task" : "TASK_ID",
    "start" : "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00"
}
```

Create a recording using the `query` method specifying a `stream` type.

```
POST /kapacitor/v1/recordings/query
{
    "query" : "SELECT mean(usage_idle) FROM cpu WHERE time > now() - 1h GROUP BY time(10m)",
    "type" : "stream"
}
```

Create a recording using the `query` method specifying a `batch` type.

```

### Wait for Recording

In order to determine when a recording has finished you must make a GET request to the returned link typically something like `/kapacitor/v1/recordings/RECORDING_ID`.

A recording has these read only properties.

| Property | Description                                                                               |

| type     | One of `stream` or `batch`. A recording cannot be replayed to a task of a different type. |
| size     | Size of the recording on disk in bytes.                                                   |
| date     | Date the recording finished.                                                              |
| error    | Any error encountered when creating the recording.                                        |
| status   | One of `recording` or `finished`.                                                           |
| progress | Number between 0 and 1 indicating the approximate progress of the recording.              |


#### Example

```
