## v1.3.0 [2017-05-22]

### Release Notes

The v1.3.0 release has two major features.

1. Addition of scraping and discovering for Prometheus style data collection.
2. Updates to the Alert Topic system

Here is a quick example of how to configure Kapacitor to scrape discovered targets.
First configure a discoverer, here we use the file-discovery discoverer.
Next configure a scraper to use that discoverer.

>NOTE: The scraping and discovering features are released under technical preview,
meaning that the configuration or API around the feature may change in a future release.

```
# Configure file discoverer
[[file-discovery]]
 enabled = true
 id = "discover_files"
 refresh-interval = "10s"
 ##### This will look for prometheus json files
 ##### File format is here https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/configuration/#%3Cfile_sd_config%3E
 files = ["/tmp/prom/*.json"]

# Configure scraper
[[scraper]]
 enabled = true
 name = "node_exporter"
 discoverer-id = "discover_files"
 discoverer-service = "file-discovery"
 db = "prometheus"
 rp = "autogen"
 type = "prometheus"
 scheme = "http"
 metrics-path = "/metrics"
 scrape-interval = "2s"
 scrape-timeout = "10s"
```

Add the above snippet to your kapacitor.conf file.

Create the below snippet as the file `/tmp/prom/localhost.json`:

```
[{
 "targets": ["localhost:9100"]
}]
```

Start the Prometheus node_exporter locally.

Now startup Kapacitor and it will discover the `localhost:9100` node_exporter target and begin scrapping it for metrics.
For more details on the scraping and discovery systems see the full documentation [here](https://docs.influxdata.com/kapacitor/v1.3/scraping).

The second major feature with this release, are changes to the alert topic system.
The previous release introduce this new system as a technical preview, with this release the alerting service has been simplified.
Alert handlers now only ever have a single action and belong to a single topic.

The handler definition has been simplified as a result.
Here are some example alert handlers using the new structure:

```yaml
id: my_handler
kind: pagerDuty
options:
  serviceKey: XXX
```

```yaml
id: aggregate_by_1m
kind: aggregate
options:
  interval: 1m
  topic: aggregated
```

```yaml
id: publish_to_system
kind: publish
options:
  topics: [ system ]
```

To define a handler now you must specify which topic the handler belongs to.
For example to define the above aggregate handler on the system topic use this command:

```sh
kapacitor define-handler system aggregate_by_1m.yaml
```

For more details on the alerting system see the full documentation [here](https://docs.influxdata.com/kapacitor/v1.3/alerts).

- [#1199](https://github.com/influxdata/kapacitor/pull/1199): BREAKING: Fix inconsistency with JSON data from alerts.
    The alert handlers Alerta, Log, OpsGenie, PagerDuty, Post and VictorOps allow extra opaque data to be attached to alert notifications.
    That opaque data was inconsistent and this change fixes that.
    Depending on how that data was consumed this could result in a breaking change, since the original behavior was inconsistent
    we decided it would be best to fix the issue now and make it consistent for all future builds.
    Specifically in the JSON result data the old key `Series` is always `series`, and the old key `Err` is now always `error` instead of for only some of the outputs.

- [#1323](https://github.com/influxdata/kapacitor/pull/1323): Fix issue where credentials to InfluxDB could not be updated dynamically.

## v1.2.0 [2017-01-23]

### Release Notes

A new system for working with alerts has been introduced.
This alerting system allows you to configure topics for alert events and then configure handlers for various topics.
This way alert generation is decoupled from alert handling.

Existing TICKscripts will continue to work without modification.

To use this new alerting system remove any explicit alert handlers from your TICKscript and specify a topic.
Then configure the handlers for the topic.

```
stream
    |from()
      .measurement('cpu')
      .groupBy('host')
    |alert()
      // Specify the topic for the alert
      .topic('cpu')
      .info(lambda: "value" > 60)
      .warn(lambda: "value" > 70)
      .crit(lambda: "value" > 80)
      // No handlers are configured in the script, they are instead defined on the topic via the API.
```

The API exposes endpoints to query the state of each alert and endpoints for configuring alert handlers.
See the [API docs](https://docs.influxdata.com/kapacitor/latest/api/api/) for more details.
The kapacitor CLI has been updated with commands for defining alert handlers.

This release introduces a new feature where you can window based off the number of points instead of their time.
For example:

```
stream
    |from()
        .measurement('my-measurement')
    // Emit window for every 10 points with 100 points per window.
    |window()
        .periodCount(100)
        .everyCount(10)
    |mean('value')
    |alert()
         .crit(lambda: "mean" > 100)
         .slack()
         .channel('#alerts')
```


With this change alert nodes will have an anonymous topic created for them.
This topic is managed like all other topics preserving state etc. across restarts.
As a result existing alert nodes will now remember the state of alerts after restarts and disiabling/enabling a task.

>NOTE: The new alerting features are being released under technical preview.
This means breaking changes may be made in later releases until the feature is considered complete.
See the [API docs on technical preview](https://docs.influxdata.com/kapacitor/v1.2/api/api/#technical-preview) for specifics of how this effects the API.

## v1.1.1 [2016-12-02]

### Release Notes

No changes to Kapacitor, only upgrading to go 1.7.4 for security patches.

## v1.1.0 [2016-10-07]

### Release Notes

New K8sAutoscale node that allows you to auotmatically scale Kubernetes deployments driven by any metrics Kapacitor consumes.
For example, to scale a deployment `myapp` based off requests per second:

```
// The target requests per second per host
var target = 100.0

stream
    |from()
        .measurement('requests')
        .where(lambda: "deployment" == 'myapp')
    // Compute the moving average of the last 5 minutes
    |movingAverage('requests', 5*60)
        .as('mean_requests_per_second')
    |k8sAutoscale()
        .resourceName('app')
        .kind('deployments')
        .min(4)
        .max(100)
        // Compute the desired number of replicas based on target.
        .replicas(lambda: int(ceil("mean_requests_per_second" / target)))
```


New API endpoints have been added to be able to configure InfluxDB clusters and alert handlers dynamically without needing to restart the Kapacitor daemon.
Along with the ability to dynamically configure a service, API endpoints have been added to test the configurable services.
See the [API docs](https://docs.influxdata.com/kapacitor/latest/api/api/) for more details.

>NOTE: The `connect_errors` stat from the query node was removed since the client changed, all errors are now counted in the `query_errors` stat.

### Release Notes

#### Alert reset expressions

Kapacitor now supports alert reset expressions.
This way when an alert enters a state, it can only be lowered in severity if its reset expression evaluates to true.

Example:

```go
stream
    |from()
      .measurement('cpu')
      .where(lambda: "host" == 'serverA')
      .groupBy('host')
    |alert()
      .info(lambda: "value" > 60)
      .infoReset(lambda: "value" < 50)
      .warn(lambda: "value" > 70)
      .warnReset(lambda: "value" < 60)
      .crit(lambda: "value" > 80)
      .critReset(lambda: "value" < 70)
```

For example given the following values:

    61 73 64 85 62 56 47

The corresponding alert states are:

    INFO WARNING WARNING CRITICAL INFO INFO OK

### Features

- [#740](https://github.com/influxdata/kapacitor/pull/740): Support reset expressions to prevent an alert from being lowered in severity. Thanks @minhdanh!
- [#670](https://github.com/influxdata/kapacitor/issues/670): Add ability to supress OK recovery alert events.

## v1.0.0-beta4 [2016-07-27]

### Release Notes

#### Group By Fields

Kapacitor now supports grouping by fields.
First convert a field into a tag using the EvalNode.
Then group by the new tag.

Example:

```go
stream
    |from()
        .measurement('alerts')
    // Convert field 'level' to tag.
    |eval(lambda: string("level"))
        .as('level')
        .tags('level')
    // Group by new tag 'level'.
    |groupBy('alert', 'level')
    |...
```

Note the field `level` is now removed from the point since `.keep` was not used.
See the [docs](https://docs.influxdata.com/kapacitor/v1.0/nodes/eval_node/#tags) for more details on how `.tags` works.


#### Delete Fields or Tags

In companion with being able to create new tags, you can now delete tags or fields.


Example:

```go
stream
    |from()
        .measurement('alerts')
    |delete()
        // Remove the field `extra` and tag `uuid` from all points.
        .field('extra')
        .tag('uuid')
    |...
```

    The configuration file being used is always logged to STDERR.
- [#298](https://github.com/influxdata/kapacitor/issues/298): BREAKING: Change alert level evaluation so each level is independent and not required to be a subset of the previous level.
    The breaking change is that expression evaluation order changed.
    As a result stateful expressions that relied on that order are broken.
- [#749](https://github.com/influxdata/kapacitor/issues/749): Fix issue with tasks with empty DAG.
- [#718](https://github.com/influxdata/kapacitor/issues/718): Fix broken extra expressions for deadman's switch.

    You may need to update your task DBRPs to use `autogen` instead of `default`.


## v1.0.0-beta1 [2016-06-06]

### Release Notes

#### Template Tasks

The ability to create and use template tasks has been added.
you can define a template for a task and reuse that template across multiple tasks.

A simple example:

```go
// Which measurement to consume
var measurement string
// Optional where filter
var where_filter = lambda: TRUE
// Optional list of group by dimensions
var groups = [*]
// Which field to process
var field string
// Warning criteria, has access to 'mean' field
var warn lambda
// Critical criteria, has access to 'mean' field
var crit lambda
// How much data to window
var window = 5m
// The slack channel for alerts
var slack_channel = '#alerts'

stream
    |from()
        .measurement(measurement)
        .where(where_filter)
        .groupBy(groups)
    |window()
        .period(window)
        .every(window)
    |mean(field)
    |alert()
         .warn(warn)
         .crit(crit)
         .slack()
         .channel(slack_channel)
```

Then you can define the template like so:

```
kapacitor define-template generic_mean_alert -tick path/to/above/script.tick -type stream
```

Next define a task that uses the template:

```
kapacitor define cpu_alert -template generic_mean_alert -vars cpu_vars.json -dbrp telegraf.default
```

Where `cpu_vars.json` would like like this:

```json
{
    "measurement": {"type" : "string", "value" : "cpu" },
    "where_filter": {"type": "lambda", "value": "\"cpu\" == 'cpu-total'"},
    "groups": {"type": "list", "value": [{"type":"string", "value":"host"},{"type":"string", "value":"dc"}]},
    "field": {"type" : "string", "value" : "usage_idle" },
    "warn": {"type" : "lambda", "value" : " \"mean\" < 30.0" },
    "crit": {"type" : "lambda", "value" : " \"mean\" < 10.0" },
    "window": {"type" : "duration", "value" : "1m" },
    "slack_channel": {"type" : "string", "value" : "#alerts_testing" }
}
```


#### Live Replays

With this release you can now replay data directly against a task from InfluxDB without having to first create a recording.
Replay the queries defined in the batch task `cpu_alert` for the past 10 hours.
```sh
kapacitor replay-live batch -task cpu_alert -past 10h
```

Or for a stream task with use a query directly:

```sh
kapacitor replay-live query -task cpu_alert -query 'SELECT usage_idle FROM telegraf."default".cpu WHERE time > now() - 10h'
```

#### HTTP based subscriptions

Now InfluxDB and Kapacitor support HTTP/S based subscriptions.
This means that Kapacitor need only listen on a single port for the HTTP service, greatly simplifying configuration and setup.

In order to start using HTTP subscriptions change the `subscription-protocol` option for your configured InfluxDB clusters.

For example:

```
[[influxdb]]
  enabled = true
  urls = ["http://localhost:8086",]
  subscription-protocol = "http"
  # or to use https
  #subscription-protocol = "https"
```

On startup Kapacitor will detect the change and recreate the subscriptions in InfluxDB to use the HTTP protocol.

>NOTE: While HTTP itself is a TCP transport such that packet loss shouldn't be an issue, if Kapacitor starts to slow down for whatever reason, InfluxDB will drop the subscription writes to Kapacitor.
In order to know if subscription writes are being dropped you should monitor the measurement `_internal.monitor.subscriber` for the field `writeFailures`.

#### Holt-Winters Forecasting

This release contains an new Holt Winters InfluxQL function.

With this forecasting method one can now define an alert based off forecasted future values.

For example, the following TICKscript will take the last 30 days of disk usage stats and using holt-winters forecast the next 7 days.
If the forecasted value crosses a threshold an alert is triggered.

The result is now Kapacitor will alert you 7 days in advance of a disk filling up.
This assumes a slow growth but by changing the vars in the script you could check for shorter growth intervals.

```go
// The interval on which to aggregate the disk usage
var growth_interval = 1d
// The number of `growth_interval`s to forecast into the future
var forecast_count = 7
// The amount of historical data to use for the fit
var history = 30d

// The critical threshold on used_percent
var threshold = 90.0

batch
    |query('''
    SELECT max(used_percent) as used_percent
    FROM "telegraf"."default"."disk"
''')
        .period(history)
        .every(growth_interval)
        .align()
        .groupBy(time(growth_interval), *)
    |holtWinters('used_percent', forecast_count, 0, growth_interval)
        .as('used_percent')
    |max('used_percent')
        .as('used_percent')
    |alert()
         // Trigger alert if the forecasted disk usage is greater than threshold
        .crit(lambda: "used_percent" > threshold)
```

## v0.13.1 [2016-05-13]

### Release Notes

>**Breaking changes may require special upgrade steps from versions <= 0.12, please read the 0.13.0 release notes**

Along with the API changes of 0.13.0, validation logic was added to task IDs, but this was not well documented.
This minor release remedies that.

All IDs (tasks, recordings, replays) must match this regex `^[-\._\p{L}0-9]+$`, which is essentially numbers, unicode letters, '-', '.' and '_'.

If you have existing tasks which do not match this pattern they should continue to function normally.

### Features

### Bugfixes

- [#545](https://github.com/influxdata/kapacitor/issues/545): Fixes inconsistency with API docs for creating a task.
- [#544](https://github.com/influxdata/kapacitor/issues/544): Fixes issues with existings tasks and invalid names.
- [#543](https://github.com/influxdata/kapacitor/issues/543): Fixes default values not being set correctly in API calls.


## v0.13.0 [2016-05-11]

### Release Notes

>**Breaking changes may require special upgrade steps please read below.**

#### Upgrade Steps

Changes to how and where task data is store have been made.
In order to safely upgrade to version 0.13 you need to follow these steps:

1. Upgrade InfluxDB to version 0.13 first.
2. Update all TICKscripts to use the new `|` and `@` operators. Once Kapacitor no longer issues any `DEPRECATION` warnings you are ready to begin the upgrade.
The upgrade will work without this step but tasks using the old syntax cannot be enabled, until modified to use the new syntax.
3. Upgrade the Kapacitor binary/package.
4. Configure new database location. By default the location `/var/lib/kapacitor/kapacitor.db` is chosen for package installs or `./kapacitor.db` for manual installs.
Do **not** remove the configuration for the location of the old task.db database file since it is still needed to do the migration.

    ```
    [storage]
    boltdb = "/var/lib/kapacitor/kapacitor.db"
    ```

5. Restart Kapacitor. At this point Kapacitor will migrate all existing data to the new database file.
If any errors occur Kapacitor will log them and fail to startup. This way if Kapacitor starts up you can be sure the migration was a success and can continue normal operation.
The old database is opened in read only mode so that existing data cannot be corrupted.
Its recommended to start Kapacitor in debug logging mode for the migration so you can follow the details of the migration process.

At this point you may remove the configuration for the old `task` `dir` and restart Kapacitor to ensure everything is working.
Kapacitor will attempt the migration on every startup while the old configuration and db file exist, but will skip any data that was already migrated.


#### API Changes

With this release the API has been updated to what we believe will be the stable version for a 1.0 release.
Small changes may still be made but the significant work to create a RESTful HTTP API is complete.
Many breaking changes introduced, see the [client/API.md](http://github.com/influxdata/kapacitor/blob/master/client/API.md) doc for details on how the API works now.

#### CLI Changes

Along with the API changes, breaking changes where also made to the `kapacitor` CLI command.
Here is a break down of the CLI changes:

* Every thing has an ID now: tasks, recordings, even replays.
    The `name` used before to define a task is now its `ID`.
    As such instead of using `-name` and `-id` to refer to tasks and recordings,
    the flags have been changed to `-task` and `-recording` accordingly.
* Replays can be listed and deleted like tasks and recordings.
* Replays default to `fast` clock mode.
* The record and replay commands now have a `-no-wait` option to start but not wait for the recording/replay to complete.
* Listing recordings and replays displays the status of the respective action.
* Record and Replay command now have an optional flag `-replay-id`/`-recording-id` to specify the ID of the replay or recording.
    If not set then a random ID will be chosen like the previous behavior.

#### Notable features

UDF can now be managed externally to Kapacitor via Unix sockets.
A process or container can be launched independent of Kapacitor exposing a socket.
On startup Kapacitor will connect to the socket and begin communication.

Example UDF config for a socket based UDF.

```
[udf]
[udf.functions]
    [udf.functions.myCustomUDF]
       socket = "/path/to/socket"
       timeout = "10s"
```

Alert data can now be consumed directly from within TICKscripts.
For example, let's say we want to store all data that triggered an alert in InfluxDB with a tag `level` containing the level string value (i.e CRITICAL).

```javascript
...
    |alert()
        .warn(...)
        .crit(...)
        .levelTag('level')
        // and/or use a field
        //.levelField('level')
        // Also tag the data with the alert ID
        .idTag('id')
        // and/or use a field
        //.idField('id')
    |influxDBOut()
        .database('alerts')
        ...

## v0.12.0 [2016-04-04]

### Release Notes

New TICKscript syntax that uses a different operators for chaining methods vs property methods vs UDF methods.

* A chaining method is a method that creates a new node in the pipeline. Uses the `|` operator.
* A property method is a method that changes a property on a node. Uses the `.` operator.
* A UDF method is a method that calls out to a UDF. Uses the `@` operator.

For example below the `from`, `mean`, and `alert` methods create new nodes,
the `detectAnomalies` method calls a UDF,
and the other methods modify the nodes as property methods.

```javascript
stream
    |from()
        .measurement('cpu')
        .where(lambda: "cpu" == 'cpu-total')
    |mean('usage_idle')
        .as('value')
    @detectAnomalies()
        .field('mean')
    |alert()
        .crit(lambda: "anomaly_score" > 10)
        .log('/tmp/cpu.log')
```

With this change a new binary is provided with Kapacitor `tickfmt` which will
format a TICKscript file according to a common standard.

## v0.11.0 [2016-03-22]

### Release Notes

Kapacitor is now using the functions from the new query engine in InfluxDB core.
Along with this change is a change in the TICKscript API so that using the InfluxQL functions is easier.
Simply call the desired method directly no need to call `.mapReduce` explicitly.
This change now hides the mapReduce aspect and handles it internally.
Using `.mapReduce` is officially deprecated in this release and will be remove in the next major release.
We feel that this change improves the readability of TICKscripts and exposes less implementation details
to the end user.
Updating your exising TICKscripts is simple.
If previously you had code like this:

```javascript
stream.from()...
    .window()...
    .mapReduce(influxql.count('value'))
```
then update it to look like this:

```javascript
stream.from()...
    .window()...
    .count('value')
```

a simple regex could fix all your existing scripts.

Kapacitor now exposes more internal metrics for determining the performance of a given task.
The internal statistics includes a new measurement named `node` that contains any stats a node provides, tagged by the task, node, task type and kind of node (i.e. window vs union).
All nodes provide an averaged execution time for the node.
These stats are also available in the DOT output of the Kapacitor show command.

Significant performance improvements have also been added.
In some cases Kapacitor throughput has improved by 4X.

Kapacitor can now connect to different InfluxDB clusters.
Multiple InfluxDB config sections can be defined and one will be marked as default.
To upgrade convert an `influxdb` config.

From this:

```
[influxdb]
  enabled = true
  ...
```

to this:

```
[[influxdb]]
  enabled = true
  default = true
  name = "localhost"
  ...
```

Various improvements to joining features have been implemented.
With #144 you can now join streams with differing group by dimensions.

If you previously configured Email, Slack or HipChat globally now you must also set the `state-changes-only` option to true as well if you want to preserve the original behavior.
For example:

```
[slack]
   enable = true
   global = true
   state-changes-only = true
```

## v0.10.0 [2016-01-26]

### Release Notes

This release marks the next major release of Kapacitor.
With this release you can now run your own custom code for processing data within Kapacitor.
See [udf/agent/README.md](https://github.com/influxdata/kapacitor/blob/master/udf/agent/README.md) for more details.

With the addition of UDFs it is now possible to run custom anomaly detection alogrithms suited to your needs.
There are simple examples of how to use UDFs in [udf/agent/examples](https://github.com/influxdata/kapacitor/tree/master/udf/agent/examples/).

The version has jumped significantly so that it is inline with other projects in the TICK stack.
This way you can easily tell which versions of Telegraf, InfluxDB, Chronograf and Kapacitor work together.

See note on a breaking change in the HTTP API below. #163
