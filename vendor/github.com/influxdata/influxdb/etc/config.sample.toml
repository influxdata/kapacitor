### Welcome to the InfluxDB configuration file.

# Once every 24 hours InfluxDB will report usage data to usage.influxdata.com
# The data includes a random ID, os, arch, version, the number of series and other
# usage data. No data from user databases is ever transmitted.
# Change this option to true to disable reporting.
reporting-disabled = false

# we'll try to get the hostname automatically, but if it the os returns something
# that isn't resolvable by other servers in the cluster, use this option to
# manually set the hostname
# hostname = "localhost"

###
### [meta]
###
### Controls the parameters for the Raft consensus group that stores metadata
### about the InfluxDB cluster.
###

[meta]
  # Where the metadata/raft database is stored
  dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/meta"

  # The default duration for leases.

###
### [data]
###
### Controls where the actual shard data for InfluxDB lives and how it is
### flushed from the WAL. "dir" may need to be changed to a suitable place
### for your system, but the WAL settings are an advanced configuration. The
### defaults should work for most systems.
###

  # this on can provide more useful output for debugging tsm engine issues.

  # log any sensitive data contained within a query.

  # CacheMaxMemorySize is the maximum size a shard's cache can
  # reach before it starts rejecting writes.

  # snapshot the cache and write it to a TSM file, freeing up memory
  # cache-snapshot-memory-size = 26214400

  # which the engine will snapshot the cache and write it to
  # a new TSM file if the shard hasn't received writes or deletes

  # that need to exist before a compaction cycle will run

  # will compact all TSM files in a shard if it hasn't received a
  # write or delete

  # MaxPointsPerBlock is the maximum number of points in an encoded
  # block in a TSM file. Larger numbers may yield better compression
  # but could incur a performance penalty when querying

### [retention]
###
### Controls the enforcement of retention policies for evicting old data.
###

###
### [shard-precreation]
###
### Controls the precreation of shards, so they are available before data arrives.
### Only shards that, after creation, will have both a start- and end-time in the
### future, will ever be created. Shards are never precreated that would be wholly
### or partially in the past.

  advance-period = "30m"

###
### Controls the system self-monitoring, statistics and diagnostics.
###
### The internal database for monitoring data is created automatically if
### if it does not already exist. The target retention within this database
### is called 'monitor' and is also created with a retention period of 7 days
### and a replication factor of 1, if it does not exist. In all cases the
### this retention policy is configured as the default for the database.

  ### Default tags that will be added to all metrics.  These can be overridden at the template level
  ### or by tags extracted from metric
  # tags = ["region=us-east", "zone=1c"]

  ### Each template line requires a template pattern.  It can have an optional
  ### filter before the template and separated by spaces.  It can also have optional extra
  ### tags following the template.  Multiple tags should be separated by commas and no spaces
  ### similar to the line protocol format.  There can be only one default template.
