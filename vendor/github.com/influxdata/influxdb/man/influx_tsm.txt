NAME
----
influx_tsm - Convert a database from b1 or bz1 format to tsm1 format

SYNPOSIS
--------
[verse]
'influx_tsm' [options] <data-path>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This tool can be used to convert a database from the deprecated b1 or bz1
formats to tsm1 format. The b1 and bz1 formats were deprecated in 0.10 and
removed in 0.12.

This tool will backup the directories before conversion (if not disabled). The
backed-up files must be removed manually, generally after starting up the node
again to make sure all of the data has been converted correctly.

To restore a backup after attempting to convert to tsm1, you shut down the
node, remove the converted directory, and copy the backed-up directory to the
original location.
